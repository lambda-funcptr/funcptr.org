You're currently reading this website right now, it has a fancy fuzzy bound harmonic graphic at the top in the header that I spent far too long design and implementing.

You can actually download the GLSL code for it from [here](/vanity/header.glsl) (GPL-3.0) if you want to poke around with it.

The site is generated by Hakyll, which is a neato Haskell static site generator.
