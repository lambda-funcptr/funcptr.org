## Matrix

Matrix is a distributed chat protocol based on federated servers that speak to each other. 
This effectively means that if you operate your own homeserver, you have a lot more control data retention, auth, voice and phone bandwidth, etc.

My matrix homeserver works and has relatively high uptime, but it's still missing a few key features like VoIP and bridging.

## Element

I'm currently running a functional Element Matrix client accessible [here](https://funcptr.org/chat), along with some self-hosted integrations.
